# Go-Introduction-Booking-APP

This repository serves as an introductory project that follows TechWorld with Nana's tutorial in [youtube!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I). 


This is a CLI application to properly learn core concepts and syntax of the Go language
- Data Types of the Go language ( Basic Types, Type conversions, Slices, Maps, Structs )
- Variables and Constants ( Syntax: declaration, assignment ) 
- Formatted Output( fmt, Printf, Println, Print, SPrintf )
- User Input: Retrieval and Validation ( Scan )
- Pointers ( Pointers to addresses of a Variable, *=value of an address, &=address; used to directly update value of a variable from within a function ) 
- Scope Rules 
- Control Flow syntax
- Function Encapsulation
- Package Data+Function Sharing ( Capitalizing public data/functions )
- Goroutines - concurrency and synchronizing concurrency ( go, WaitGroup )
